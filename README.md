#### Something that I wrote on the evolution of the song, "Odd Jobs," by Captain Beefheart

So, I have an answer to a question that nobody asked: &quot;What is your favorite Captain Beefheart song?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Why that would have to be Odd Jobs.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Odd Jobs - Captain Beefheart<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHMgHnHSv88" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHMgHnHSv88</a><br />&nbsp;<br />I like this mashed-up version of the song best, because you can hear Beefheart&#039;s early piano version flow into full band version and then back out again into the early piano version. Basically, this one captures all of the lore of his compositions and some of his best lyrics. <br />&nbsp;<br />From what I understand, Beefheart could not read music; instead, he would<a href="https://youtu.be/oV5Bd8Eu0ko?t=30" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank"> whistle</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/ED3oIxZKgU4" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank"> throw tin ashtrays at walls </a>(<em>That&#039;s the drum solo! Learn it!</em>), and bang at his piano while recording his musings on a tape recorder. Apparently, Beefheart&#039;s rough recorded demo for the song can be heard here: <a href="https://youtu.be/oqafZFTFiLw" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">Odd Jobs - Piano Demo</a>. It is quite beautiful to me, even without the words. <br />&nbsp;<br />I can imagine Don playing away into the recorder what he was hearing in his head...and then his elves (mainly, Drumbo-the-elf and the later elf, Gary Lucas) taking the recording, creating the compositions, the parts, and bringing it to life, while Beefheart would nap and then take credit for the band&#039;s work upon waking up. Here is the song as a work in its final version: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQYLA_Qr3vEs" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">Odd Jobs - 2012 remaster.</a> <br />&nbsp;<br />The lyrics, too, are pure poetry. For me, Beefheart&#039;s story of Odd Jobs - a hobo who rides a &quot;form-a-heap&quot; bike but &quot;don&#039;t come around anymore&quot; with his &quot;candy store&quot; - and his descriptions of the setting, where maybe a child is looking out a window from her perch in the world amid carpet backing, tacky wallpaper, and dead flies collecting on the window sill - are magical.&nbsp; Maybe it is because I grew up in a neighborhood where there were lots of &quot;Odd Job&quot; characters around who would come and go (and go they would by police car, hearse, or the (H)orse) that I find the song, story, and lyrics so compelling. <br />&nbsp;<br />Finally, for those who have read this far, there is a great John Peel documentary on Captain Beefheart <a href="https://youtu.be/BN-WtV-IL68" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">here</a>. If for nothing else, it is worth hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/dBa8bS_vZkM?t=633" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">Ry Cooder&#039;s story of the &quot;joys&quot; of working with Beefheart</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br /><sub>[Verse 1]</sub><br /><sub>The rug ripped up in cloth popcorn balls</sub><br /><sub>The walls an old candy striped sack</sub><br /><sub>In the corner wrinkled black and white</sub><br /><sub>A table held up by legs</sub><br /><sub>The peeled back red enamelled mouth of linoleum screamed</sub><br /><sub>At the pasteboard door</sub><br /><sub>A knob rolled off in some corner sticky</sub><br /><sub>A curtain blew into a sink</sub><br /><sub>Dead flies and newspapers</sub><br /><sub>Charred fire brown wings and toast</sub><br /><br /><sub>[Verse 2]</sub><br /><sub>Hobo ain&#039;t been around for some time</sub><br /><sub>The gate danced without its paint on</sub><br /><sub>&quot;Odd Jobs&quot; is written on</sub><br /><sub>Spiders were the window&#039;s eyes</sub><br /><sub>The sun made them look silver</sub><br /><sub>The little girl from in back of the clothesline</sub><br /><sub>Cast a shadow like a crow</sub><br /><sub>It&#039;s beak spoke open</sub><br /><sub>Why doesn&#039;t old Odd Jobs come around anymore</sub><br /><sub>He used to ride his form-a-heap bike</sub><br /><sub>And his basket was a whole candy store</sub><br /><sub>He used t&#039;make Xs from door to door</sub> <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/4c/b6/c64cb6ebb45bbc6016e55cc9290b4da6.jpg" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank"><sup>link to find why X marks the spot</sup></a><br /><sub>All the women and the young girls around here<br />Ask why old Jobs don&#039;t come around anymore<br />Ask why old Jobs don&#039;t come on home<br />And the gate without its paint on danced<br />And creaked and moaned<br /></sub><br /><sub>[Outro]<br />Here he comes peddlin&#039; up on his form-a-heap bike<br />A bag of skin and bones<br />Spokes were scraping two rust fenders, oh<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>One wonders if <a href="http://www.beefheart.com/herb-bermann/" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">Herb Bermann</a> contributed anything to the lyrics on this one.</em><br /><br />
